 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project 📊

🚀 Project Overview
This project was created as part of the **MLSA Data Science & AI Bootcamp** at **MLSA FAST PWR**. It focuses on **analyzing COVID-19 data** using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains country-wise COVID-19 statistics, including confirmed cases, new cases, recoveries, and more.

 🔧 Features Implemented
 Data Loading & Preprocessing
  - Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
  - Handled missing values using forward fill (`ffill`).
  - Converted the date column to a proper format.

 Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn:
  - 📊 **Pie Chart:** Showcasing COVID-19 cases distribution by country.
  - 📈 **Bar Chart:** Comparing new COVID-19 cases across WHO regions.
  - 📉 **Histogram:** Displaying the distribution of recovered cases.

- Key Findings:
  - The USA had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
  - The Americas region reported the most new cases.
  - Recovered cases were highly uneven across different countries.

🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
